This Project is my interpretation on Gertrude Stein's writing titled "On Punctuation"

I depicted her writing in a more retro video game style, playing around with pixel fonts and outset borders.

I replaced the words of the punctuations with the symbold themselves, making them larger and in color, and I made it so hovering over them changes it back to the word.
