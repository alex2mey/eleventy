<p>I chose to reminisce on my childhood through showcasing the music I listened to growing up on a recreated iPod.
<br>
<br>
I created the iPod in CSS and through the use of Javascript and JSON I was able to create a functional iPod where people can come and listen to the songs from my childhood.
    <br>
    <br>
I made sure to link the interactive aspects of the website to the iPod buttons too, to make sure it felt like you were using an actual iPod</p>
