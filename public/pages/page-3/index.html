<p>I chose to display the data from the NYC Open Data set on Urban Park Ranger Calls. There was a very large amount of information so I decided to showcase the information within Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx.
<br>
<br>
I have the landing page set as a radio, but the About and Call Log pages set to be in a simplifies expanded screen of the radio.
    <br>
    <br>
Similarly to my previous project I chose to make sure the way the interaction of the website works related back to the object I was basing it on. In this case the focus was on the radio buttons.</p>
